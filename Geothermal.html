		<P>At a geothermal power plant, wells are drilled 1 or 2 miles deep into the Earth to pump steam or
		hot water to the surface. You're most likely to find one of these power plants in an area that has a
		lot of hot springs, geysers, or volcanic activity, because these are places where the Earth is particularly
		hot just below the surface.</P>

					<li>Hot water is pumped from deep underground through a well under high pressure.</li>
					<li>When the water reaches the surface, the pressure is dropped, which causes the water to turn into steam.</li>
					<li>The steam spins a turbine, which is connected to a generator that produces electricity.</li>
					<li>The steam cools off in a cooling tower and condenses back to water.</li>
					<li>The cooled water is pumped back into the Earth to begin the process again.</li>
