		<P>So just how do we get electricity from water? Actually,
		hydroelectric and coal-fired power plants produce electricity in a similar way.
		In both cases a power source is used to turn a propeller-like piece called a turbine, which then
		turns a metal shaft in an electric generator, which is the motor that produces electricity. A coal-fired
		power plant uses steam to turn the turbine blades; whereas a hydroelectric plant uses falling water to turn
		the turbine. The results are the same.</P>

			As to how this generator works, the Corps of Engineers explains it this way:
			"A hydraulic turbine converts the energy of flowing water into mechanical energy. A hydroelectric generator converts
			this mechanical energy into electricity. The operation of a generator is based on the principles discovered by Faraday.
			He found that when a magnet is moved past a conductor, it causes electricity to flow. In a large generator, electromagnets
			are made by circulating direct current through loops of wire wound around stacks of magnetic steel laminations.
			These are called field poles, and are mounted on the perimeter of the rotor. The rotor is attached to the turbine shaft,
			and rotates at a fixed speed. When the rotor turns, it causes the field poles (the electromagnets) to move past the
			conductors mounted in the stator. This, in turn, causes electricity to flow and a voltage to develop at the generator output
			terminals."


		<H4>Pumped storage: Reusing water for peak electricity demand</H4>
			Demand for electricity is not "flat" and constant. Demand goes up and down during the day, and overnight there is less
			need for electricity in homes, businesses, and other facilities. For example, here in Atlanta, Georgia at 5:00 PM on a
			hot August weekend day, you can bet there is a huge demand for electricity to run millions of air conditioners! But,
			12 hours later at 5:00 AM .... not so much. Hydroelectric plants are more efficient at providing for peak power demands
			during short periods than are fossil-fuel and nuclear power plants, and one way of doing that is by using "pumped storage"
			, which reuses the same water more than once.
			<BR><BR>
			Pumped storage is a method of keeping water in reserve for peak period power demands by pumping water that has already
			flowed through the turbines back up a storage pool above the powerplant at a time when customer demand for energy is low
			, such as during the middle of the night. The water is then allowed to flow back through the turbine-generators at times
			when demand is high and a heavy load is placed on the system.
			<BR><BR>
			The reservoir acts much like a battery, storing power in the form of water when demands are low and producing maximum
			power during daily and seasonal peak periods. An advantage of pumped storage is that hydroelectric generating units
			are able to start up quickly and make rapid adjustments in output. They operate efficiently when used for one hour or
			several hours. Because pumped storage reservoirs are relatively small, construction costs are generally low compared
			with conventional hydropower facilities.
