            I am currently a student at Romeo High School in Romeo, Michigan. I enjoy many hobbies such as 3D printing, camping, 
            fishing ,robotics, wood working, programming, CAD, and much more. On top of all of my hobbies I am also an eagle scout 
            from troop 208 out of Shelby Township.

              This is my 3D printer, it is a cr10s. Over the past 10 months I have been playing with it and modifying it.
              I have modified my printer to use a clone E3D V6 hotend, stepper dampeners, klipper firmware, 
              and a bltouch. During the 2020 Coronovirus pandamic I lead design and communications of a group of people 
              who were using their own personal printers to print faceshield. Our teams efforts ended when we produced 
              our 10600th face shield due to a limit in money and supplies. On top of the faceshield production and design 
              I have also 3d printed many of my own projects (you can read about it in my CAD section).

              I have been a part of the first robotics team 3539 for four years now. For the first three years I was a programmer 
              on the programming subteam. While I was programming I would help with CAD, Electrical, and Fabrication. For my forth 
              year I was lead programmer, my job was to lead a group of programmers in programming basic and advanced robot controls. 
              While I continue my education I am planning on mentoring the robotics team.
