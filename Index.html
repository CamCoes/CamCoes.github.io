          I am currently a student at Romeo High School in Romeo, Michigan. I enjoy many hobbies such as 3D printing,
          camping,
          fishing, robotics, wood working, programming, CAD, and much more. On top of all of my hobbies I am also an
          eagle scout
          from troop 208 out of Shelby Township.

          This is my 3D printer, it is a cr10s. Over the past 10 months I have been playing with it and modifying it.
          I have modified my printer to use a clone E3D V6 hotend, stepper dampeners, klipper firmware,
          and a bltouch. During the 2020 Coronovirus pandamic I lead design and communications of a group of people
          who were using their own personal printers to print faceshield. Our teams efforts ended when we produced
          our 10600th face shield due to a limit in money and supplies. On top of the faceshield production and design
          I have also 3d printed many of my own projects (you can read about it in my CAD section).

                I have been a part of the first robotics team 3539 for four years now. For the first three years I was
                a programmer on the programming subteam. While I was programming I would help with CAD, Electrical,
                and Fabrication. For my forth year I was lead programmer, my job was to lead a group of programmers in
                programming basic and advanced robot controls. While I continue my education I am planning on
                mentoring the robotics team.

              <p class="ex2">
                2017 was a fun year. The 2017 game contained 3 major robot functions, shooting fuel, delivering gears
                to
                your steamship, and climbing a rope at the end of the match. Since 2017 was my first year on the team
                I
                didn't get to do as much as I would have liked to do on this robot. During the build season I mainly
                worked on vision tracking, during our needs and wants meeting we had determined that the robot should
                have vision tracking to self align itself with the target before shooting. In the end our vision
                tracking system contained a Raspbery PI 3, 2 usb cameras, and 2 green leds, and custom python code.
                This
                system was able to track retroreflective tape located on the target. In addition to vision tracking I
                also worked on the robots autonomous routines. During the first 15 seconds of the game all robots will
                move autonomously, our robot was able to do nearly all of the available tasks during this time. During
                the offseason I explored fabrication on the team by improving our climber. Originally our climber ran
                on
                one cim motor, my idea was to switch it to two 775 pro motors to improve speed and prevent breaker
                trips.

              <p class="ex2">
                2018 was a great year. The 2018 game contained 2 major robot functions, manipulating power cubes, and
                climbing. Power Up was my second year on the team, I was able to do alot more things that my first
                year
                on the team. This year I mainily worked on motion profiling and robot control. Motion profiling was
                used
                during the 15 second autonomous period and was capable of positioning the robot to a final target
                while
                following a preprogrammed path within a 6" tolerence (this was then improved in 2019). On top of
                motion
                profiling I also worked on other robot control such as binding specific robot function to the driver
                and
                operators controllers.

              <p class="ex2">
                While 2019 was not the best year that the team had at competitions it was one of the best for
                learning.
                During 2019 we designed and built a very complex robot with many aspects. The robot was a great
                learning
                tool teaching us what parts of the design were good and what was bad. This years game had 3 different
                major robot functions, manipulate cargo, manipulate hatch panels, and to climb a 6", 13", or 19" step.
                This was the first year that I really stepped outside of the programming aspect of the robot, I helped
                pick electrical sensor, and design custom circuits for the robot's different functions. After picking
                those sensor or designing them, I cadded custom cases for every sensor that didn't have one. In
                addition
                to helping electrical and CAD I also helped fabricate multiple axles, and custom cnc elevator rollers.
                Although I was helping the other subteams make the robot I still had plenty of time to develop a new
                vision tracking system and to update our motion profiling system to be accurate within 2".

                The 2020 season had the potential to be one of our best years however it was abruptly cut short by the
                2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Our robot was built from all of our learning experiences from our 2017 to 2019
                seasons.
                During this year I spent most of my time programming our new swerve drive. This year despite loosing
                most of our programmers to graduation our robot had some of our most complex control, the robot was
                equiped with coordinate based motion profiling, vision tracking (based on 2017), and many accurate pid
                controllers. Ontop of programming most of the robots control I also cadded the shooter mechanism for
                the
                robot.

                This CAD model was created in the 2020 robotics seasons. During the 2020 season I was lead programmer
                however our cad team was lacking members and was in need of assistance, since I didn't have a robot to
                program I decided to assist with cad so I designed our shooter mechanism. This shooter mechanism is
                designed to be able to shoot 7" dodge balls over 30 feet at almost any arc.

                This CAD model was created in the 2019 robotics offseasons. This was a project that I did during the
                2019 robotics offseason. I decided to do this project when a new motor was announce from one of FIRSTS
                electrical supplier CTRE. The purpose of the project was to enhance my knowledge of fusion 360 and to
                create something that may be useful during the 2020 season.

                design is
                based off of the 3D Verkstan Model it has many changes to it to conform to the doctors needs. The
                model
                has a decreased forhead gap and a larger gap between the face and the shield. These changes will allow
                for people with larger glasses to wear the shield, and the smaller forhead gap will allow for more
